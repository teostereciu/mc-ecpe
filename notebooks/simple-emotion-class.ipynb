Chandler just left though ! <eol>  <sol> Yeah but , maybe it is not what we think . Maybe it is tell Monica I am sorry I ... drank the last of the milk . <eol>  <sol> Or maybe he ... he was writing to tell her that ... that he is changed his name , you know ? Tell Monica I am sorry . <eol>  <sol> I think it means he freaked out and left ! <eol>  <sol> Do not be so negative ! Good God !

It is just so sad . <eol>  <sol> I did not know Ross and you were so close . <eol>  <sol> We were not but we had one class together . He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science . I always remembered him . <eol>  <sol> I am sure that would mean a lot to him . <eol>  <sol> And if heaven has a door , I am sure he is pressing his ear up against it and listening intently . <eol>  <sol> I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out . I guess I really missed my chance . <eol>  <sol> But you did not ! <eol>  <sol> I am still alive ! ! <eol>  <sol> Kori , I know this is a big surprise for you . <eol>  <sol> It is a long story but the things you just said really made my day ! <eol>  <sol> I mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people ! <eol>  <sol> You sick freak , who does that ?
